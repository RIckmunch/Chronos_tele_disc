Yes, traditional medicine has been described in mechanisms of action. Several papers detail molecular and systemic approaches that analyze how herbal compounds interact with biological targets. For example, one study describes how plant secondary metabolites covalently and non-covalently modify proteins and DNA, thereby elucidating specific mechanisms underlying traditional remedies (wink2015modesofaction pages 5-9). Other research applies systems pharmacology to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations, dissecting multi-target and synergistic interactions through network pharmacology methods, which further elucidates the mechanistic action underlying these systems (zhang2019systemspharmacologyfor pages 1-2, zhang2019systemspharmacologyfor pages 12-13, zhang2019systemspharmacologyfor pages 11-12).

Mechanistic descriptions are also offered through traditional conceptual frameworks. One account explains that TCM rationalizes its therapeutic interventions using the philosophical concepts of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements, which serve as a basis for understanding and classifying disease and treatment (che2024traditionalmedicine pages 2-4). Such descriptions indicate that traditional medicine has long possessed its own scheme of mechanistic action, even if articulated differently from modern scientific paradigms. Moreover, the discovery of artemisinin serves as a concrete example where traditional remedies have been linked to distinct and identifiable mechanisms of action, contrasting with conventional drug effects (yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 7-8, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 8-10).

Additional sources further attest to the convergence of traditional and modern pharmacological descriptions. One paper discusses how traditional practices, including those of TCM, are increasingly being integrated with modern biomedical frameworks, providing insights into the active compounds and their molecular targets (yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 1-3). Similarly, other works emphasize ongoing efforts to uncover the molecular underpinnings of TCM interventions, noting that modern techniques are progressively mapping the interactions between herbal ingredients and biological processes (yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 5-6, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 3-5).

There are also discussions addressing complexities inherent in some traditional approaches. For instance, the mechanisms of action for adaptogens and other herbal remedies are noted to be multifaceted and are not entirely described by modern pharmacological standards; however, the challenges highlighted do not negate that mechanisms are at least partially understood within both traditional frameworks and modern reinterpretations (elisabetsky2002traditionalmedicinesand pages 3-6, elisabetsky2002traditionalmedicinesand pages 1-3). Lastly, another perspective underscores that traditional practices, particularly in psychopharmacology, contribute to an evolving understanding of drug actions by elucidating how physiological responses are modulated by these remedies (elisabetsky2002traditionalmedicinesand pages 8-10).

Based on the evidence from these sources, detailed accounts and analyses support the claim that traditional medicine has been described in terms of mechanisms of action. The literature provides both traditional philosophical explanations and modern molecular interpretations, thereby confirming that mechanisms of action in traditional medicine have indeed been described (wink2015modesofaction pages 5-9, zhang2019systemspharmacologyfor pages 1-2, zhang2019systemspharmacologyfor pages 12-13, che2024traditionalmedicine pages 2-4, elisabetsky2002traditionalmedicinesand pages 3-6, elisabetsky2002traditionalmedicinesand pages 8-10, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 1-3, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 5-6, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 7-8, zhang2019systemspharmacologyfor pages 11-12, elisabetsky2002traditionalmedicinesand pages 1-3, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 3-5, yuan2016thetraditionalmedicine pages 8-10).
